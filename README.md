# Machine-learning applied to radar remote sensing

This is my Final Year Project as a Computer Engineering student in the National University of Singapore. 
We embarked on a project to investigate the problem of Land Subsidence all over the world, and make use of machine learning to analyse the data.

## Objectives of the project

### Investigating Land Subsidence
### Using SAR Imaging
### Implementing Machine Learning to analyse data

## How it works
